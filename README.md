# ConnectMyPool (Home Assistant / HACS)

A polished Home Assistant custom integration for **AstralPool ConnectMyPool**.

It talks to the official ConnectMyPool cloud endpoints documented in the *Home Automation Integration Guide* (PoolConfig/PoolStatus/PoolAction).

## What you get

- **Pool water temperature** sensor
- **Channel controls**
  - `select` entities for **channel mode** (Off/Auto/On/Speed modes)
  - Optional convenience `switch` entities for quick On/Off (enabled by default)
- **Valve mode** selects (Off/Auto/On)
- **Lighting**
  - `light` entities (On/Off + optional effects/patterns)
  - Separate lighting **Mode** select (Off/Auto/On) because “Auto” doesn’t fit the light model cleanly
  - “Color Sync” diagnostic button (matches the official action)
- **Heater** as a proper `climate` entity (Off/Heat/Cool where supported)
- **Solar** as a proper `water_heater` entity (Off/Auto/On + setpoint)
- Advanced service: `connectmypool.send_action` (raw action code access)

## Important note: API throttle

The ConnectMyPool cloud throttles **poolconfig** and **poolstatus** to about **one response per 60 seconds**, except for ~5 minutes after an instruction is sent.

This integration is designed around that: default scan interval is 60s, and it uses cached data if the cloud replies with a throttle error.

## Install (recommended via HACS)

1. Create a GitHub repo and copy this code into it (or unzip the provided zip and push it).
2. In Home Assistant: **HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories**
3. Add your repo URL and select **Integration**
4. Install **ConnectMyPool**, then restart Home Assistant.
5. Add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → ConnectMyPool**
6. Enter your **Pool API Code** (from the ConnectMyPool app), choose °C/°F if needed.

## Options

In **Settings → Devices & Services → ConnectMyPool → Configure**:

- Scan interval (60–3600 seconds)
- Wait for execution (recommended ON; avoids UI “flip-flop”)
- Expose channel switches (ON/OFF convenience toggles)
- Expose legacy setpoint numbers (diagnostic; usually unnecessary with climate/water_heater entities)
- Base URL (only change if you’re explicitly told to)

## Troubleshooting

- If entities “snap back”: enable **Wait for execution** and keep scan interval ≥ 60s.
- If you see “Pool not connected”: the controller isn’t currently connected to ConnectMyPool’s cloud (Wi‑Fi / gateway / service issue).
- Diagnostics: **Settings → Devices & Services → ConnectMyPool → Download diagnostics** (API code is redacted).

## Entity ID prefix helper

This integration includes a service `connectmypool.apply_entity_id_prefix` that can rename the integration's entities in your entity registry to include a prefix (default: `connectmypool_`). Run it once with `dry_run: true` to preview, then again with `dry_run: false` to apply.
